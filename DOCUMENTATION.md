 Add handlers for session events
5. Document configuration options

## Performance Considerations

### Large Projects
- File analysis is parallelized based on CPU cores
- Test output comparison uses streaming for large outputs
- Migration tracking uses atomic file operations
- Audit logs are automatically rotated

### Memory Usage
- Files are processed in chunks
- Large test outputs are normalized in streaming fashion
- Dependency graph uses efficient data structures

## Security Considerations

### File Integrity
- All file operations verified with SHA256 hashes
- Metadata preserved (permissions, timestamps)
- Atomic operations prevent partial states

### Audit Trail
- Tamper-evident logging with checksums
- Complete operation history
- User attribution for all decisions

### Data Protection
- No files are permanently deleted
- Archive location configurable
- Sensitive file patterns can be excluded

## Conclusion

VibePruner provides a safe, reliable way to clean up projects while ensuring continued functionality. Its comprehensive tracking, multi-layered analysis, and robust rollback capabilities make it suitable for production use on critical projects.

The system's design prioritizes:
1. **Safety** - No destructive operations
2. **Reliability** - Complete tracking and rollback
3. **Transparency** - Full audit trail
4. **Usability** - Clear UI and helpful defaults
